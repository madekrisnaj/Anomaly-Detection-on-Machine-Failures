# Anomaly-Detection-on-Machine-Failures
Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) uses sensor to to collect real-time measurement (ie. pressure, temperature, and vibration). CBM data allows maintenance personnel to perform maintenance at the exact moment it is needed, prior to failure. In this case, we will build an anomaly detection model for vibration failure dataset using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder model.
