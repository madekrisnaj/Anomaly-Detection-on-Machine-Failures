# Anomaly Detection on Machine Failures

## Overview
Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) uses sensor to to collect real-time measurement (ie. pressure, temperature, and vibration). CBM data allows maintenance personnel to perform maintenance at the exact moment it is needed, prior to failure. 

Key take-aways from use case:
